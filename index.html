        <p>The food is very delicous and tasty and have good portions. It is a good place to go with family. The service is usually very good, but things can take some time. You can have the food made in front of you which is fun. I would recommend to go for anyone who hasn't tried yet.</p>

        <p>It's same old McDonald's, but this one is a mixed bag. The lines can be atrocious and usually they are super slow. Besides that the food is just McDonald's, classic american burgers and sandwiches.</p>

        <p>Texas Roadhouse is a fun restaurant great for families, and has equally good food. The food is pretty good and cooked to order, but sometimes it gets bad at times. The rolls are really freakin good however, which takes away the cake. Good restaurant.</p>

        <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h3>
        <p>It is a nice place to get some classic diner food and breakfast. They also have some Greek food; their gyros are really good, but there is a lot of onion. Their breakfast is pretty decent; it is not the best but it gets the job done. I would recommend to go with a group of people like your friends or family. Overall The Olympic Diner is a pretty above average place.</p>

        <h3> &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h3>
        <p>Good for groups, specials, and sports games. Our the having rooster pile and fry pickles of appetizer. Those was that little dried and the heavy, fry pickles having that lot more breading than most places too highly on I opinion. Our everyone the keep quarter pound burger though and it were highly recommend. The wings was also huge and perfectly the cook, mediums buffalo sauce were pretty spicy on I opinion. The home made ranch also fantastic!</p>

        <p>My goto fast food choice. Healthy food that tastes delicious, and it's also very filling. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Mexican food. It's basically Mexican Subway, if you don't like it, it's because you didn't pick out the right stuff.</p>

        <p>They have great take out, and its fun to make your own fajita. Great to have for with your whole family. Sometimes tortiallas will be a little soggy, but most are good. The Nachos are good. I can't speak for the other menu items, because I have not had them. Overall its a good place.</p>

        <p>I love chipotle. My favorite part about it is that you can get as many toppings as you want and it is included in thr price (except for queso and guac). It is so diverse that everyone is sure to find something they like. It is the ideal resturant! </p>

        <p>Really good food with large portions. It's very filling and delicious. The only downside is that the food could be considered expensive, but it's not surprising considering the portions you recieve. I highly recommend this to anyone else. Arguably the best Greek food in Hilliard.</p>

        <p>The food at game arena is very flavorfull. I personally love their boneless wings which are very full of meat and worth the price. It only takes about 15 minutes for the food to be finished and they take it to the computer you are sitting at.</p>

        <h3> &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h3>
        <p>AMC has quite diverse menu and I would argue most things are worth trying. I would highly recommend the cinnamon sugar pretzel bites or the mac and cheese bites. They have the coca-cola freestyle machines at most AMC's, would recommend the sweet tea. Very good menu, nothing super amazing other than those two items.</p>

        <p> You'll find food here you won't find anywhere else. While they have a large selection of food for takeout, most of it is bland and flavorless. I appreciate the experimentation with pellet food, but I personally can't stand the texture. I would not recommend going here.</p>
